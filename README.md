# Data-Science
This repository is dedicated to my data science learning roadmap. 

# Data Science with Python:
A folder dedicated to my practice and learning Python libraries useful for data science including numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
The project includes analysis of data to explore its different features and visualization of the distribution of data.

# Data Science Project 1:
An end-to-end data science project with linear regression model building, a flask server for the backend, and an HTML, CSS, and JS website for the front-end.
Here is the complete blog explaining my project working in detail:
